OAuth stands for Open Authorization

It allows 2 applications to communicate with one another through the use of tokens.
For example, you can give Spotify permission to post things to your Facebook profile without giving them your username and password.
This protects both sites - Facebook isn't responsible for holding your username and password for Spotify, and if they were to be hacked, they wouldn't get your Spotify credentials.

Keep in mind, this is an **authorization** method, not an authentication method.

Authorization is asking for permission to do things.

Authentication is providing credentials (username and password) to prove you are the correct person.

Spotify OAuth Flow

Roles

1. Resource Server - The API that holds information the application wants to access (Spotify API in this case).
2. Resource Owner - The person owns the data in the resource server (Spotify User).
3. Client - The application that wants to access your data (Spotify Stats).
4. Authorization Server - Server that receives requests from the client for access tokens and issues them upon successful auth and consent by th resource owner.

Scopes - specify exactly which resources should be available upon successful authorization.
Only the information third party apps choose to be shared will be shared and nothing more.

Tokens

With every API request, an access token will be included in the HTTP request headers. If it isn't, the API won't know our app has been authorized by the user.
It will reject our requests for any data.

Before any client or server requests are made, OAuth requires a Client ID and a Client Secret to kick off OAuth flow.
Once these are obtained, the OAuth Flow is as follows:

1. Client requests authorization to access data using Client ID and Client Secret to auth server. Scopes can be included in this request.
2. Auth server authorizes access to client. Verification of Client ID and Secret followed by checks that requested scopes are permitted.
3. User grants app access to their data. This typically happens through a redirect to the account service of whatever app we are trying to interface with (Spotify account service in this case).
4. Client receives access token from Spotify. Redirect back to original application.
5. Client uses access token to request data from Spotify.

Wrapping Up

- OAuth is an authorization protocol
- Authorize without giving away credentials
- Use access tokens in API requests
