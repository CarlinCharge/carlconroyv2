What are requests made of?

1. The endpoint url
2. The HTTP method
3. The HTTP headers
4. The body data

5. Any website you visit is known as the base URL.

https://diablobuilds.com/

Depending on what you ask for, a following endpoint will return different resources to you

https://diablobuilds.com/authors

Returns a list of all authors from the website

https://diablobuilds.com/authors/staff

Returns the author page for just that author. Also known as the /:id or slug page.

2. HTTP methods are the types of requests we send to the server

The 5 most common are

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

You have probably seen these defined in the context of a CRUD app so they're often bundled together.
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete which is what these HTTP requests allow you to perform.
