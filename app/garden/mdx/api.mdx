What is an API?

API stands for **Application Programming Interface**

More simply, it's a set of rules that allow pieces of software to talk to one another.

A consumer (user) of your API doesn't need to know all the complex code necessary to play a song or go to the next video.
We abstract away all that complex logic so the consumer just needs something simple

function onClick (){
youtubeVideoPlayer.play();
}

This is just an example of the type of thing we'd put in an API for an external user of a service to use.
We want to make the life of the developer or user easier. They don't need to know what the play(); method actually does.

Where have I encountered API usage even if I haven't worked directly with another app?

const element = document.querySelector('selected');

The word DOM is thrown around a lot in development, but what's really happening here is that we are interacting with the Document Object Model API.
The **document** object is our entry point for the DOM API and 'querySelector' is the method we are using.
