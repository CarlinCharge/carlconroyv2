Getting Started with Express

Express is a framework that provides HTTP methods and middleware to create API's.

A project I've been building that implements it is **[Spotify Stats](https://github.com/CarlinCharge/spotifystats)**

Install nodemon and add to package.json

```
"start:dev": "nodemon index.js"
```

So you can run `npm run start:dev` for file watching and remove need to restart server every time.
